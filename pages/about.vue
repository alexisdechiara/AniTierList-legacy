      This website is in no way related to AniList.co, it is a site created in a totally independent way by Alexis De Chiara whose goal is to allow the realization of tier list with the anime coming directly from an AniList account.
      Any resemblance with this one is voluntary and to have an interface as close as possible to the API it uses, therefore no connections with other APIs than anilist will be made and this in order to promote Anilist.co.
